# Discord-Unban
This plugins main and only function is to unban people directly from a discord chat.
It hooks into [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/). It reuses the bot provided by the plugin to listen for the command specified in the config.
It can automatically resolve mentions, if the account is linked with a minecraft account in DiscordSRV. You can also input a MC username directly.
