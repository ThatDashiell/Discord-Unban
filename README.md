# Discord Unban
Easily view bans and unban people via discord! Made for spigot 1.12. [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) is needed.
- Reuses the DiscordSRV bot. So no new bot needs to be set up.
- Automatically converts from discord mentions to mc names. If the account is linked in DiscordSRV
- You can still use mc names if the account isn't linked
- Support for [DkBans](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dkbans-bansystem-playermanagement-json-mysql-sqlite-mongodb-bukkit-bungeecord.52570/) *shows the unbanners name in the dkbans logs; show ban history; etc*
